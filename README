This is a first pass implementation of a cover tree in c/c++.  It is
somewhat optimized and not terribly robust.  


'test_nn <int> <file>' checks the running times of tree creation and
			querying for <int> nearest neighbors for every point in <file>.

'knn <int> <file1> <file2>' computes the <int> nearest neighbors of every point in <file2>
			    amongst the points in <file1>
